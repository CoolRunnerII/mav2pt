Sometimes, when the ESP32 version of MavToPass is used where the WiFi RF environment is hostile, 
10 write() retries before disconnecting can take up 10 seconds, during which time the pilot may lack
critcal situational awareness.

10 x 1000000uS = 10 seconds - see below

During that time the WiFiClient object blocks all other processing. The blocking time can be reduced
 by reducing the retries to (say) 2 or 3. Please understand you do this at your own risk.

TO CHANGE WIFI TCP READ() AND WRITE() DEFAULT RETRIES

Find and open Open WiFiClient.cpp, usually located at :

%systemdrive%:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\esp32\hardware\esp32\1.0.4\libraries\WiFi\src\


Line 26:

#define WIFI_CLIENT_MAX_WRITE_RETRY   (10)
#define WIFI_CLIENT_SELECT_TIMEOUT_US (1000000)

change to 

#define WIFI_CLIENT_MAX_WRITE_RETRY   (3)
#define WIFI_CLIENT_SELECT_TIMEOUT_US (1000000)

Save WiFiClient.cpp, and rebuild the application
